# EDA on Flight Price Dataset

## Project Overview
    This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a flight price dataset.
    The main goal is to uncover insights about how different features such as airline, source, destination, duration, stops, and travel date influence flight ticket prices.


 ### By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:

    Understand data distributions and key patterns

    Identify correlations between features and flight price

    Detect outliers and anomalies in pricing

    Prepare insights that can help in price prediction models 

### Key Steps in EDA

   Data Cleaning

     Handling missing values

     Correcting data types (date, time, categorical variables)

     Removing duplicates

  Feature Engineering

    Extracting day, month, and year from date of journey

    Splitting duration into hours and minutes

    Encoding categorical variables (airline, source, destination, etc.)
    
  Tech Stack

    Python

    Pandas, NumPy for data wrangling

    Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualization

    Jupyter Notebook for analysis
